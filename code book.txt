The run_analysis.R script gets and cleans data from the specified URL through the following steps:

Sets directory and download data file:
  1. Check the directory and create data directory if it does not exist already
  2. Download data file from URL
  3. Unzip the data file
  4. Get the files from data folder called UCI HAR Dataset
  
Reads the text files and store data in data frames (Train and test dataset)

  features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
  The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
  
  activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
  List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

  sub_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
  contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
  
  x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
  contains recorded features test data
  
  y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
  contains test data of activities’code labels

  sub_train <- train/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
  contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

  x_train <- train/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
  contains recorded features train data
  
  y_train <- train/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
  contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

  mergedDataset (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

    tidyDataSet (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

    Entire numbers in code column of the tidyDataSet replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable


Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

  Code column in tidyDataSet renamed into activities
  All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
  All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
  All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
  All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
  All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
  All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

  FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.

Writes the result in text file

  Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
